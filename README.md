# Predicting_European_Soccer_Matches

Abstract

Sports analytics has boomed in recent years with the explosion in available data to data. One of the biggest analytic interests is predicting the results of games. Soccer, the world's most popular sport, is full of data for this kind of analysis. This report will look into predicting various game outcomes for European soccer games using player rating data from EA Sport's FIFA video game series. The expected goal differential and total goals scored will be modeled using multiple linear regression and support vector machines. Win probabilities will be predicted using t-stat and poisson distributions. Finally, projected final standings will be created using these models. The goal for this report is to use these modelling methods to create reliable models for creating these outcomes. All of these game outcome predicitons are important to all kinds of people from front office executives to coaches to sports bettors. Given how much money is tied up into soccer, it is important for everyone involved to have the most accurate analytic information.

This is the project I submitted for my senior capstone at Case Western Reserve University.
